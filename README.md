Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the provided dataset to clean and format the
external status descriptions and internal status labels for training the machine
learning model.
Model Development: Develop a machine learning model using TensorFlow or
similar frameworks to predict the internal status based on the external status
descriptions. Experiment with different architectures and algorithms to achieve
optimal performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the developed model on the preprocessed
dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy,
precision, and recall.
API Development: Implement an API using FastAPI framework to expose the
trained machine learning model. The API should accept external status descriptions
as input and return the predicted internal status labels.
Testing and Validation: Test the developed API thoroughly to ensure its
functionality and accuracy. Validate the predictions against a validation dataset to
measure the model's generalization ability.
Documentation: Document the entire development process, including data
preprocessing steps, model architecture, training procedure, API implementation,
and testing results.
